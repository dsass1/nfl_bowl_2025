# Pre-Snap Advantage: Modeling Rush Direction in the NFL

In football, an offensive play typically involves either 
a pass or a rush. For a defensive team, accurately predicting 
the type of play offers a significant strategic advantage. 
Prior research has demonstrated that distinguishing 
between pass and rush plays can be achieved with 75-80% 
accuracy using a limited set of variables (Joash Fernandez et al., 2020). 
Building on this foundation, our study focuses on 
enhancing the defensive advantage by using a 
boosted tree model to predict the 
direction of a rush; categorized as left, middle, or right. 
More importantly, we seek to include spatial tracking 
variables and aim to identify any variables that 
may be key indicators of rush direction, 
offering deeper insights into offensive tendencies.
