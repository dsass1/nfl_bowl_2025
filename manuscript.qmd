## Introduction

In football, an offensive play typically involves either a pass or a rush. For a defensive team, accurately predicting the type of play offers a significant strategic advantage. For instance, anticipating a rush allows the defense to position more players in the box, while expecting a pass might prompt defenders to drop back into coverage. Prior research has demonstrated that distinguishing between pass and rush plays can be achieved with 75-80% accuracy using a limited set of variables (Joash Fernandez et al., 2020). Building on this foundation, our study focuses on enhancing the defensive advantage by predicting the direction of a rush; categorized as left, middle, or right. More importantly, we seek to include spatial tracking variables and aim to identify any variables that may be key indicators of rush direction, offering deeper insights into offensive tendencies. 

## Data preparation

To predict rush direction, we use tracking, play-by-play, player, and game data from the 2022 NFL season, provided by the NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 (Lopez et al., 2024), along with supplementary data from the `nflverse` package (Carl et al., 2023). Our analysis focuses exclusively on rush plays, totaling 6,183 observations. Scramble plays, while typically categorized as rushes, were excluded since they originate as pass plays and involve decisions made after the snap. This aligns with our emphasis on leveraging pre-snap information.

### Rush direction

Upon visualizing a sample of plays, we identified discrepancies between the tracking data and the provided rush location types. Given the lack of detailed documentation on how rush direction was determined and to enhance prediction accuracy, we recalculated rush direction manually using the tracking data.

At its simplest, rush direction is categorized as "left," "middle," or "right," based on the ball carrier's path relative to the offensive linemen. Specifically, a rush is classified as:

- Left: if the ball carrier advances past the leftmost offensive lineman,
- Right: if they advance past the rightmost offensive lineman,
- Middle: if they advance between these two outside linemen.

\noindent Figure @fig-run illustrates a play where the ball carrier rushes to the left of the leftmost offensive lineman. However, the data provided misclassified this play as "inside-left," which corresponds to "middle" under this definition.

```{r}
#| label: "fig-run"
#| fig.cap: "caption here"

knitr::include_graphics("images/01_run_definition.gif")
```

In more complex scenarios where the ball carrier does not advance past the offensive linemen or does not cross the line of scrimmage, we use the coordinates of the outside linemen at the line set to determine whether the rusher moved to the left, right, or middle relative to the linemen.

### Spatial variables {#sec-spatial-var}

Pre-snap data was utilized in building the predictive model.
When a player is rushing they are looking for a gap or hole to run through created by their team. We want to explore if pre-snap player orientation provides insight into a potential gap creation which could indicate where the rusher plans to go. 


#### Sequential Offensive Player Gap 

Assuming the offensive and defensive players near the line of scrimmage are positioned one yard away from the line of scrimmage, we project all players positions one yard forward in the direction of their orientation, such that all players are in a single line at the line of scrimmage. A gap is defined if there are two offensive players in a row, or if an offensive player is next to the sideline. The gap is categorized as `left`, `right`, or `middle` based on the gaps position relative to the outside offensive linemen. The value of the gap is calculated as the distance between the two offensive players. 

 @fig-run-gap2 demonstrates a play with no left gaps, two middle gaps, and two right gaps. When there are multiple gaps in a region the largest gap is chosen. The play has the following sequential offensive player gap values: 
 
  - left: 0
  - right: 21.34
  - middle: 1.87

```{r}
#| label: "fig-run-gap2"
#| fig-cap: "caption here"
#| out.width: "100%"

knitr::include_graphics("images/03_run_gap_manual.png")

```

#### Orientation Gap

We first calculate the left, middle, and right gap size based on offensive player orientation. If two players in a row are oriented away from each other, or if the end player is oriented away from the sideline then a gap is present, with intuition that the players are trying to push the defense in opposite directions forming a gap. The gap size is quantified as the distance between the offensive players. @fig-run-gap shows a left gap between the sideline and player 1; a middle gap between players 4 and 5; and a right gap between player 9 and the sideline.

```{r}
#| out.width: "100%"

knitr::include_graphics("images/02_run_gap_manual.png")

```

```{r}
#| label: "fig-run-gap"
#| fig-cap: "caption here"

rownames(run_gap_table) <- c("player", "orientation")

run_gap_table |>
  gt(rownames_to_stub = T) |>
  fmt_number(rows = "player",
             decimals = 0) |>
  fmt_number(rows = "orientation",
             decimals = 2) |>
  tab_style(
    style = list(
      cell_fill(color = "#F0E442", alpha = 0.5),
      cell_text(weight = "bold")
      ),
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = c(2, 5, 6, 10)
    )
  ) |>
  tab_options(
    column_labels.hidden = TRUE
  )

```

#### Quarterback and Running Back Variables

Other spatial variables include the running back and quarter back orientation, distance between the RB and QB, if the RB is positioned to the left or right of the QB, if the RB was in motion or shifted. 

Additionally, we considered the RB's historical tendencies. For all games prior to the week we calculate the percent of times the RB ran left, right, and middle. If there are multiple RB's on the play we took the average. We considered the current game's historical tendencies. For all plays prior to the current play what percent of the runs were left, right, and middle (again especially for early week games prior season data could improve results).


### Other variables {#sec-other-var}

In addition to these calculated variables we consider the following variables: `quarter`, `down`, `yards to go`, `absolute yardline number`, `possession team`, `defensive team`, `offense formation`, `receiver alignment`, `play clock at snap`, `coverage`, `number of defenders in box`, `number or running backs`, `number of wide receivers`, and an indicator if the play was `no huddle`. See the data codebook for a more detailed explanation of the variables.

## Model

The data was split into a training set consisting of weeks 1 through 6 and a testing set of weeks 7 through 9. Due to the severe class imbalance in run direction (numbers here) we downsampled the training set to prevent overfitting. We fit the training set to a boosted tree model using v-fold cross validation with 4 folds and 3 repeats. All variables mentioned in @sec-spatial-var and @sec-other-var The optimal tuning parameters were found to be STATE PARAMETERS.

We predicted the rush direction on the test dataset and achieved a `r accuracy_main*100`% accuracy.

```{r}
# Visualize confusion matrix
predictions |> 
  conf_mat(rush_loc_calc, .pred_class_main) |> 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```


This low accuracy is not surprising as the offense is not going to telegraph their play. Due to the severe class imbalance, while it is true a naive guess of "middle" for every rush could offer better accuracy it would provide no intuition on variable importance.
To determine whether or not the spatial tracking variables offer any insight into rush direction we compare our model results to a baseline model. This baseline model utilizes only the variables from @sec-other-var and a boosted tree model was tuned. The resulting accuracy on the testing set was `r accuracy_base*100`%. 

## Insights

Inclusion of the spatial tracking variables improves prediction accuracy by `r accuracy_main*100 - accuracy_base*100`%. To better understand the significance of these variables we look at the variable importance results from the boosted tree model.
