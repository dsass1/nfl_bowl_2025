    "# Pre-Snap Advantage: Modeling Rush Direction in the NFL\n",
    "\n",
    "[Danielle Sass](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-sass-63a4915b/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In football, an offensive play typically involves either a pass or a rush. For a defensive team, accurately predicting the type of play offers a significant strategic advantage. For instance, anticipating a rush allows the defense to position more players in the box, while expecting a pass might prompt defenders to drop back into coverage. Prior research has demonstrated that distinguishing between pass and rush plays can be achieved with 75-80% accuracy using a limited set of variables (Joash Fernandez et al., 2020). Building on this foundation, our study focuses on enhancing the defensive advantage by predicting the direction of a rush; categorized as left, middle, or right. More importantly, we aim to incorporate novel spatial tracking variables and identify those that serve as key indicators of rush direction, providing deeper insights into offensive tendencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict rush direction, we use data from the 2022 NFL season, provided by the NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 (Lopez et al., 2024), along with supplementary data from the `nflverse` package (Carl et al., 2023). Our analysis focuses exclusively on rush plays, totaling 6,183 observations. Scramble plays, while typically categorized as rushes, were excluded since they originate as pass plays and involve decisions made after the snap. This aligns with our emphasis on leveraging pre-snap information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rush direction\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon visualizing a sample of plays, we identified discrepancies between the tracking data and the provided rush location. Given the lack of detailed documentation on how rush direction was determined and to enhance prediction accuracy, we recalculated rush direction manually using the tracking data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its simplest, rush direction is categorized as left, right, or middle, based on the ball carrier\\'s path relative to the offensive linemen. Specifically, a rush is classified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `left`: if the ball carrier advances past the leftmost offensive lineman on the left,\n",
    "* `right`: if they advance past the rightmost offensive lineman on the right,\n",
    "* `middle`: if they advance between these two outside linemen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 illustrates a play where the ball carrier rushes to the left of the leftmost offensive lineman. However, the data provided misclassified this play as \"inside-left,\" which corresponds to \"middle\" under this definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/dsass1/nfl_bowl_2025/blob/main/images/01_run_definition.gif?raw=true\" width=\"90%\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "Figure 1: This play shows a direct snap to T. Etienne. T. Etienne rushes left of the outside linemen.\n",
    "</center>\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- knitr::include_graphics(\"images/01_run_definition.gif\") -->\n",
    "<!-- ``` -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In more complex scenarios where the ball carrier does not advance past the offensive linemen or does not cross the line of scrimmage, we use the coordinates of the outside linemen at the line set to determine whether the rusher moved to the left, right, or middle relative to the linemen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial tracking variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-snap data was used to build a predictive model. When rushing, a player looks for a gap created by their teammates to run through. We aim to investigate whether pre-snap player orientation and positioning offers insights into potential gap formation, which could signal the rusher\\'s intended direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential offensive player gap \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the offensive and defensive players near the line of scrimmage are positioned one yard away from it, we project all players positions forward in the direction of their orientation. This adjustment aligns all players along the line of scrimmage. \n",
    "\n",
    "A gap is defined as an open space between two offensive players positioned consecutively, or between an offensive player and the sideline. Gaps are categorized as left, right, or middle based on their position relative to the outermost offensive linemen. The size of a gap is calculated as the distance between the two offensive players forming it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 demonstrates a play with no left gaps, two middle gaps, and two right gaps. When multiple gaps exist within a region, the largest gap is selected. The sequential offensive player gap values for this play are as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    "  - `left`: 0\n",
    "  - `right`: 21.34\n",
    "  - `middle`: 1.87\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ```{r} -->\n",
    "<!-- #| label: \"fig-run-gap2\" -->\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orientation gap\n",
    "\n",
    "Now considering only the offensive players near the line of scrimmage, a gap is defined as an open space between two offensive players oriented away from each other, or if the outermost player is oriented away from the sideline. If players are oriented in opposite directions the intuition is that they are trying to push the defense in opposite directions. Again, gaps are categorized as left, right, or middle based on their position relative to the outermost offensive linemen and the size of the gap is the distance between the two offensive players forming it. Figure 3 shows a left gap between the sideline and player 1; a middle gap between players 4 and 5; and a right gap between player 9 and the sideline. \n",

    "\n",
    "We also incorporate the RB\\'s historical tendencies. For all games prior to the current week, we calculate the percentage of runs directed left, right, or middle by the RB. If multiple RBs participated in the play, we use the average of their tendencies. Similarly, we consider game-specific tendencies by calculating the percentage of runs to the left, right, and middle for all plays in the current game leading up to the play being analyzed.\n",

    "The low accuracy is unsurprising, as offenses are unlikely to telegraph their plays. While a naive strategy of always predicting \"middle\" could yield higher accuracy (`r accuracy_naive*100`%) due to the class imbalance, such an approach would provide no insights into variable importance. The accuracy of `r accuracy_main*100`% is certainly better than that naive approach on a balanced dataset (33.3%).\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate whether the novel spatial tracking variables contribute meaningful insights into rush direction, we compared our model\\'s performance to a baseline model.

    "Next we examine the relationship between the normalized size of sequential offensive player gaps and rush direction, as shown in Figure 6. The \"left gap size\" plot illustrates the distribution of left gap sizes across all rush plays. Notably, plays where the rusher ran left tend to have a larger median gap size compared to plays with middle or right rush directions. Similarly, larger middle gap sizes are associated with rushes through the middle, while larger right gap sizes correspond to rushes to the right. These patterns indicate a weak but observable relationship between spatial gap size and rush direction.\n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilized a boosted tree model to predict whether the rusher on a play runs to the left, right, or middle of the offensive linemen. The inclusion of novel spatial tracking variables improved prediction accuracy over the baseline model by `r accuracy_main*100 - accuracy_base*100`%. We identified a very weak relationship between gap sizes and rush direction, we also found that a running back\\'s (RB\\'s) historical tendencies have a small, yet measurable, influence on the rush location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing a strong run game is critical for an offense as it helps open up the passing game, wear down the defense, and control the clock. Conversely, limiting an opponent\\'s run game makes defensive play calling and execution easier. Although the overall model accuracy of `r accuracy_main*100`% is modest, the findings suggest that defenses should prepare for rushes in any direction and that post-snap developments may provide more actionable insights into rush direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research could focus on using functional data to evaluate an RB\\'s effectiveness in rushing middle versus outside routes or on quantifying an offensive line\\'s impact through post-snap spatial gap sizes and their contributions to successful rushing plays.\n",
